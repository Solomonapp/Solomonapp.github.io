  I am a Computer Science student; I studied BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma in Networking and Digital Forensics at college, I learned the fundamentals of networking such as looking at networks, databases, security, computer systems etc. During the two years in the course, it has developed me into a better and more confident person, with learning the technical aspect.
My degree is focused on studying the topics of Computer Science; AI,Database Systems, Computer Animation and Multimedia; Programming; Network Fundamentals; Software Engineering; Information Security and Computer Operating Systems; Natural Computation, Data Structures and etc.       
The course also combines practical projects and theoretical study, developing technical and transferable skills in:     
•	Graphical Programming: Processing, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe XD, Android Studio.     
•	Web Development Languages: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, JSON, SQL server and Ajax.     
•	Programming Languages: Java and Python.     
•	Time Management and Organisation: Regularly exercise conscious control over the amount of time spent on projects/coursework; often applying methods such as goal setting and    prioritising workload in accordance with what is ‘achievable’ and ‘realistic’ against other commitments/the time frame available to meet strict assignment deadlines are met.           
•	Communication: Under the guidance of tutors, participate in group discussion work with the purpose of exchanging ideas and reaching impartial decisions on topics programmed into the course syllabus; at times, delivering conclusions in the form of a visual and verbal presentation (utilising Microsoft PowerPoint) to classmates.     
•	Teamwork and Leadership: Regularly work in a team of four to six people to complete assigned projects. Inspire and motivate team members through offering encouragement, support and displaying a ‘can do’ attitude.        
•	Report Writing: Analyse various sources of information and communicate findings in a structured, coherent and persuasive manner - employ Microsoft Word to present findings in the form of a written argument.
